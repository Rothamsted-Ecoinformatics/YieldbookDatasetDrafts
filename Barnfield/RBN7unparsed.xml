62/A/5.

In 196k the rate of application of P205 was increased to 122.5 1b
per acre, thus permitting the use of compound 0:14:28 on strips 2, &
and 6. Granular superphosphate was applied to strips 5 and
7 (at 645 1b per acre, supplying 122,5 1b P205). Potash, sodium
and magnesium were applied normelly,
