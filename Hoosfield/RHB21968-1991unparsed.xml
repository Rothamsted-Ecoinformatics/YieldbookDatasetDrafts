Cultivations, etc,: Ploughed: Sept 21, 1951. Dung applied: Deo 18,
Ploughed: Dec 19, Fertilizers applied: Feb 27, 1952, Seed
Grilled at 3 bushels per acre; Feb 29, Sprayed with D.N.0.C,

1 gallon per acre; May 9, Harvested: tug 1, Varicty: Plumage
Archer,

Note: Owing to a very heavy infestation by Wild Oats (Avena Fatua)!

~~ the major part of each plot was cut and carted green before the
oats ripened, The remainder (gonerally 1/25 - 1/50 acre) was left
to ripen, and the yields shovm are measured from these small areas,

BARLEY - HOOSFIELD 1955
The 104th year

For history, details of treatments, etc., see "Results of the Field
Experiments" 1939-47,Vol.I, Section A/2.

In the autum of 1954 a system of chalking was started as follows:-
strips 5 and 4, including plots 50 and 5A, receive a dressing of
5 tons of calcium carbonate per acre as ground chalk in 1954-55
only. Plots receiving ammonium sulphate or castor meal have a
compensating dressing of ground chalk at the following rates:
100 1b calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N applied as ammonium
Sulphate; 50 1b calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N given as
castor meal. The compensating dressings, at five times the
annual rate, are given once every five years commencing 1955.

Cultivations, etc.: Ploughed: Sept 27, 1954. Part of ground chalk
applied to strips 3 and 4: Nov 6-18 Dung applied: Nov 15.
Ploughed: Dec 27. Remainder of ground chalk applied to strips
3 and 4, and compensating dressing applied to series A end C:
Mar 17, 1955. ertilizers applied: Apr 5. Seed drilled at
3 bushels per acre: Apr 7. Sprayed with 8 lb D.N.C. (active
substance) in 6 gallons per acre: May 24. Cut and discarded
areas of plots in series N, AA, AAS, C and plots 5A and 50, leaving

yields were estimated from 2 combine cuts per plot. Manures
were applied to the full plot areas as hitherto.

On plots showing an uneven growth, strew weights were recorded
for all cuts; on the remainder one weight only was taken from
& cut chosen at random.

The appearance of the crop in early May indicated that plot 4AAS
had not received seedbed nitrogen and that plot 4AA had
received a double dressing in error, Plot 4AAS was therefore
top-dressed with the correct dressing on May 20.
