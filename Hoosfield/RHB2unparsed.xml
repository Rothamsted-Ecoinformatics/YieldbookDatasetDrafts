Note: Owing to a very heavy infestation by Wild Oats (Avena Fatua)!

the major part of cach plot was cut and carted green before the
oats ripened, The remainder (generally 1/25 - 1/5 acre) was left
to ripen and the yields shown arc measured from those small arcas,

BARLEY - HOOSFIELD 1955
The 104th year

For history, details of treatments, etc., see "Results of the Field
Experiments" 1939-47,Vol.I, Section A/2.

In the autumn of 1954 a system of chalking was started as follows:-
strips 3 and 4, including plots 50 and 5A, receive a dressing of
5 tons of calcium carbonate per acre as ground chalk in 1954-55
only. Flots receiving ammonium sulphate or castor meal have &
compensating dressing of ground chalk at the following rates:
100 1b calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N epplied as ammonium
sulphate; 50 1b calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N given as
castor meal. The compensating dressings, at five times the
annual rate, are given once every five years commencing 1955.

Cultivations, etc.: Ploughed: Sept 27, 1954. Part of ground chalk
applied to strips 3 and 4: Nov 6-18, Dung applied: Nov 15.
Ploughed: Dec 27. Remainder of ground chalk applied to strips
3 and 4, and compensating dressing applied to series A and C:
Mar 17, 1955. Pertilizers applied: Apr 5. Seed drilled at
3 bushels per acre: Apr 7. Sprayed with 8 1b D.N.C. (active
substance) in 80 gallons per acre: May 24. Cut and discarded
areas of plots in series N, AA, AAS, C and plots 5A and 50, leaving
16 rows per plot: July 25. Harvested: Aug 18. Variety:

In 1959 the plots wers harvested by taking a single combine cut down

full length, except on strips 1, 3 and 4, where five combine cuts
were taken per plot and weighed seperately, the yields shown
being estimated from the totels of these cuts. One cut only
was taken from plot 5 - A, situated at the south side to avoid

HOOSFIELD: BARLEY AND THREE-COURSE ROTATION 1968
(HB)
The 117th year, lst year of revised scheme

For ‘history, treatments, etc., see 'Details 1967' and Station Report
for 1965.

Cropping and treatments:

A three-course rotation (potatoes, spring beans, spring barley) is now
followed on parts of the old series AA, AAS and C, The remainder of
these series, the old series 0 and A and old plots 1N, 2N, 5-0, 5A,
6-1, 6-2, 7-1, 7-2, carry continuous barley,

The arrangement is indicated below:-
014 Series 0 A “mm AAS c IN, 2N
5-0,5-A
(Bast): 1968 B B B P PB B B P Be B (West)
1969 B BB Be BeB B P BeB B
1970 3B B B B BB B BeB P B
1971 B B BP P.B BE B P Be B
(B = Barley, Be = Beans, P = Potatoes)
Varieties in 1968:
Barley - Maris Badger, Beans - Maris Bead (seed inoculated with
Rhizobium), Potatoes - Majestic,
The strip manures:
+ Strip 1 - None
2-P
3 = KiaMg
4 - PKNaMg ”
continue to be applied at the same rates, but are now applied in sutumn
before ploughing, Fermyard manure (D) at 14 tons is applied to plot 7-2
as hitherto and silicate of soda is applied as hitherto (old series AAS),
The rete is unchanged but it too is applied before ploughing, Castor
meal is no longer epplied, All plots (except IN, 2K, 5-0, SA) are
split into 4 sub plots and (except on plot 7-2) a test is mede of
none (NO), 43(N1), 86(W2), 129 (3) 1b N as 'Nitro-Chalk 21' applied
to the barley seed bed, Potatoes receive basal 'Nitro-Chalk' at
129 1b N before rotary cultivation in spring, beans receive no N,
The levels of N to barley are cumulative and are randomized, Plot
7-2 in 1968 had a test on duplicate sub plots of NO and N1*¥, Plots
68/a/2,2
IN (now numbered 581), 2N (571), 5A (551), receive N2, plot 5-0 (561)
NO. Plots 5-0, and SA receive PK, at rates as before but applied
before ploughing in autum,
* NOTE: In 1968 sub plots on the old plots 6-1, 6-2, 7-1 and 7-2
received nitrogen at rates 57 (N1) 115 (N2) and 172 (N3) 1b
N in error,
Symbols:
D - 1L tons farmyard manure
P - Superphosphete supplying 30 1b P
K - Sulphate of potash supplying 80 1b K
Ne - Sulphate of soda supplying 14 1b Ne
Mg - Sulphate of magnesia supplying 10 1b Mg
Si - 400 1b silicate of soda,
Standard applications 1968:
To Barley: (weedkiller) dicamba/mecoprop/MCPA ('Banlene Plus' at U

Under the new scheme ground chalk will be applied every third year,
starting Autumm 1970.
