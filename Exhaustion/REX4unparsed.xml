In 1957 the eastern halves of all strips - plots 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 = were
cropped separately under a modified scheme of multiple cropping to
test levels of P and K menurings The yields from these plots will
be given in the 1953 report.

On the western halves - plots 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 - the land was bere-
allowed except for a 90 link length on each plot which wes sown
to barley.

In 1959 the whole experiment was sown to barley egain,

Combire harvesting 1959:- One central cut was teken down the
length of each plot except plots 5 and 5, 90 links at the end
of plots 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 being discarded; parts of plots
5 and 9 were harvested separately as microplots and the remainder
discarded.

The following should be added to the details for 1958:

Combine harvesting 1956:~ The barley crop on the western halves
wes combine harvested, one central cut being taken from plots
4, 6, 8 and 19, and from plot 2, two cuts separately, one on
the north side and the other on the south side.

Besal dressing: 0,5 owt N per acre as 'Nitre-Shell'.
