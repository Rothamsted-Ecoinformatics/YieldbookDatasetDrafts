A suiteble dressing of calcium carbonate will be applied every 6 years
before the Test Barley crop.

(a) 1st dressing of N, and N, in spring. Repeated dressings of
N, and N, at the dane rafes after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th otc.outs
(lot thellast).

(v) 41st dressing of N, and N, in spring. A second dressing at
the se rates laler in The swmer (in third year after hay
is cut).

(c) N as sulphate of ammonia to Potatoes only.

The basal dressing is applied as a Granulated Compound containing 13%
P.O, 13% KO.

Sheep Grazing Technique. This has been modified since the experiment
started, the present scheme being as follows:

The grazing unit is a half plot of about 1/25 acre. This is
presented to the sheep as two or more folds, the team being of
such a size that it will greze a single fold to about the level
of the sample cut (2") in one day. The intention is to provide
fresh untainted grazing every day, leaving the grazed area as a
run backs To equalize conditions between the folds within one
sub plot, the order of grazing the folds is reversed at every
cycle, i.e, the fold which was grazed first on one cycle is
grazed last on the next.

Quarter plot area: 0.0220 acre.

LEY AND ARABLE ROTATIONS

Highfield and Fosters Field 1960 - the 12th year.

For details of treatments, rotations, etc. see "Details of the
Classical and Long Term Experiments" 1956.

Second yeer lucerne: Three applications of sodium molybdate were
mede as a foliar spray to small areas before each cut, These
areas were harvested separately.

Rate of application: 4 oz of sodium molybdate in 700 gellons per
acre, applied to same area for each cut.

In 1960 yields of areble hay, cut grass and silage were estimated
(except where otherwise stated in "Cultivations, etc.") from
samples cut by a flail action forage harvesters Two sample
strips 40" wide were cut from each sub-plot.

IEY AND ARABIE ROTATIONS
(HIA and FIA)
”

Highfield and Fosters Field 196, the 17th year.

For details of treatments, rotations etc., see 'Details' and
‘Results’ 63/B/1.1 and 64/B/1.1.

Winter wheat: A further test of 0 v 0.6 N (T0 v T1) is now applied
as 'Nitro-Chalk' in December or early Janwery. The 1965 crop
received additional K20 at 0.6 cwt on the plough furrow, as
muriate of potash.

Potatoes: All fertiliser tests on potatoes are discontinued, except
the comparison of dung and PK (0.5 cwt P205, 1.0 owt K20 as (0:14:28))
on Quarter plots. The basal compound is now (15:15:15) applied
at 1.2 cwt N, 1.2 owt P205 and 1.2 cwt K20.

Sugar beet: The N test is discontinued. The basal nitrogen is 1.5
cwt N, partly epplied in the besal compound (now 15:15:15) and
partly as 'Nitro-Chalk'.

Hy: This is no longer undersown. Italian ryegrass is sown in
autum or spring. The menuring remains the same but the basal
NPK is applied in the seedbed (for spring sowing) or in early
spring (for autum sowing).

Lucerne: An infestation with stem eelvorm (Ditylenchus dipsaci) made
it necessary to plough out one whole plot of third year lucerne
an each field.

NOrES: (1) The wheat following ryegrass (replacing 3rd year 'all-grass'
ley) on Fosters wes badly thinned in spring by stem-boring
larvae.

(2) Weather prevented the last cutting planned for lst and 2nd
year all-grass and clover-grass leys, also permanent and
reseeded grasses. g

For deteils of treatments, rotations, etc. see 'Details' 1967 and
'Results' 68/B/1.
Revised NPK dressings to wheat (2nd, Lith and Sth test crops):
Basal dressings: 0,4 cwt P205, O.4 cwt K20 broadcast by drill
before ploughing and 0,5 cwt P205, 0,5 cwt K20 combine
drilled, Both dressings as (0320320).
Fitrogen: 2nd test crop: 0,0 (NO), 0.4% (M1), 0.8 (R2), 1.2 (N3) owt
K as 'Nitro-Chalk' to 1/8th plots in spring.
4th end 5th test crops: 0.6 (x2), 1.0 (52), 1.4 (N3), 1.8 (Bb4) owt

All-gress leys, reseeded (Ri) and permanent (GN) grass: The

Object: To study the effects of three-year leys on the fertility of
the soil as measured by a =equence of three arable test crops.
Since 1968, continuous wheat has been grown after the three test

followed the Arable rotation. In 1973 some of these plots were
returned to reseeded grass.
Since 1975 the all-grass half plots of the reseeded grass plots have been

From 1968 only two phases on each field have continued in the original

<![CDATA[T8/R/RN/1 and 78/R/RN/2

From 1963 (reseeded) and 1968 (old grass) some grass plots were ploughed and
cropped with the same test crops as above, thereafter these plots followed
the ARABLE rotation. In 1973 some of these plots were returned to reseeded
grass.

From 1968 only two phases on each field continued in the original six-course
rotation (the museum blocks). The four other phases (the new sequence
blocks) were sown to wheat every year at the end of the test-crop cycle.

In both 1977 and 1978 one phase, fallowed in the previous year started a
new sequence of treatment cropping. In 1978 one of the remaining phases
was fallowed and the other remained in wheat (no yields). The new sequences
will be introduced progressively on these remaining phases. The new
sequences are:

SEQUENCE Treatment crops Test crops

LUCERNE (previously LUCERNE) * LU, LU, LU W, W, W, W

CLOGRA (previously CLOGRA) LC, LC, LC W, W, W, W

GRASS/G (previously GRASS) R, R, R W, W, W, W

ARABLE/A (previously ARABLE) 0, P, BE W, W, W, W

ARABLE/R (previously RESEEDED) B, B, W VW, W, W, W

GRASS/0G . (previously OLDGRASS) R, R, R W, W, W, W
R= ryegrass, BE = beans. Other symbols as above. All ploughed at the
end of the treatment crop cycle except GRASS/OG = direct drilled to
wheat. Treatment crop cycles start after nine previous cereals followed by
one fallow. In treatment years yields are taken only from barley and
wheat.

Additional treatments to 3rd test crop wheat in the original rotation:-

Fram 1963 (reseeded) and 1968 (old grass) some grass plots were ploughed and
cropped with the same test crops as above, thereafter these plots followed
the ARABLE rotation. In 1973 some of these plots were returned to reseceded
grass.

Fram 1968 only two phases on each field continued in the original six-course
rotation (the museum blocks). The four other phases (the new sequence
blocks) were sown to wheat every year at the end of the test-crop cycle.

In 1977, 1978 and 1979 one phase, fallowed in the previous year started a
new sequence of treatment cropping. In 1979 the remaining phase was
fallowed prior to introducing the new sequences in 1980. The new sequences
are:

R = ryegrass, BE = beans. Other symbols as above. All ploughed at the
end of the treatment crop cycle except GRASS/OG ~ direct drilled to

one fallow. In treatment years yields are taken only from barley and
wheat.
