microbial activity ~ Woburn, Butt Close West.
Sponsors: S.P. McGrath, A. Chaudri.
The fifth year, s. wheat. For previous year see 98/W/CS/439.
Design: 3 randomised blocks of 11 plots.
Whole plot dimensions: 1.2 x 3.5.
Treatments:
SALTS
A None (duplicated)
Z2N1 Zinc at rate 1
ZN2 Zinc at rate 2
2N3 Zine at rate 3
cul Copper at rate 1
cu2 Copper at rate 2
cu3 Copper at rate 3
cD1 Cadmium at rate 1
cD2 Cadmium at rate 2
cD3 Cadmium at rate 3
Experimental diary:
22-Dec-98 : B: : Raked. Broadcast Riband, tr. Beret Gold, at 600
seeds/m by hand. Raked.
19-Mar-99 : B: : Raked. Broadcast Chablis, tr. Sibutol, at 330 seeds/m’
by hand. Raked.
29-Apr-99 : B: : Muriate of potash at 183 kg. 27% N at 648 kg.
07-May-99 : B: : Ally at 30 g in 200 1.
20-Aug-99 : B: : Hand harvested. .
NOTES: (1) The winter wheat failed and was resown to s. wheat.

(2) The yields of two plots with treatments CD1 and CU2 were lost due
to poor establishment. Estimated values were used in the
analysis.
