W/CS/10,1973,"Plots which had received no lime grew little crop and became very weedy. Yields were taken from combinations of no lime with P and K together (both blocks) and with P alone (one block only), the remaining plots with no lime were cut green in July and rotary cultivated",comment

R/CS/10,1974,"Estimated values were used in the analysis for yields from one plot, LIME - 20, P2O5 - 125, K2O - 0, because there were both visual and analytical evidence that K residues from an unknown source affected growth over most of the plot area",comment
