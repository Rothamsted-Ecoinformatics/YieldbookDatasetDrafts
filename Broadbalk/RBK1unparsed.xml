WHEAT - BROADBALK 1955
The 112th year

For history, details of treatments etc. see "Results of the Field
Experiments" 1939-47,Vol.I, Section A/1.

Commencing in autumn 1954 a scheme of chalking was introduced as
follows:= the half of section V nearest the drain received a
single application of 5 tons of calcium carbonate per acre as
ground chalk for this year only. On all plots receiving either
ammonium sulphate or castor meal an annual compensating dressing
of ground chalk will be applied at the following rates: 100 lb

- of calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N applied as ammonium sulphate;
50 1b of calcium carbonate for each 14 1b of N applied as castor
meal. In autumn 1954 this compensating dressing was given at
double rate; henceforward it will be given at single rate on the
stubble.

No compensating dressing is given to the section under fallow or to
plots 17 and 18 in their 'no nitrogen! years.

In 1955 Section I was harvested in two separete sub-sections IA and IB,
Starting in 1956 IA (nearest the wilderness) will carry wheat without
fallow; IB will continue in the fallowing cycle.

Cultivations, etc.:

Cropped sections. Ground chalk applied to lower half of Section Vi
Sept 28-Oct 21, 1954. Dung applied. ploughed all plots: Oct 1.
Ground chalk applied to ammonium sulphate and castor meal plots:
Oct 20. Autumn fertilizers applied: Nov 5. Seed drilled at
3 bushels per acre: Dec 6. Spring fertilizers applied:

May 16, 1955. Second dressing of nitrate of soda applied
to plot 16: June 1. Harvested: Aug 19. Variety:
