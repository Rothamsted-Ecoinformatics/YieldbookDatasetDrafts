63/B/4, 64/B/4, 65/B/4 and 66/B/4,

Potatoes: Because of the poor appearance of the crop in June plots
were split for a test of nitrogen and mgnesium sulphate:-

None (0), l.84 1b N as 4% solution of urea per acre (U) and
None (Mg), 0.5 lb Mg as 5% solution of MgSOk, 7 H20 (Mg)
hand sprayed at 50 gal. The solutions contained 'Shellastol'
wetter at 0.01%,

There was no apparent improvement in the appearance of the
crop and yields taken of the sub plots were not taken
separately.

Rye: The crop partially failed and was replaced with spring wheat
variety Kloka, which received a basal dressing of 0.6 cwt N as
